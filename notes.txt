front end  => html, css, bootstrap, javascript, react

backend => node, express, mongodb

integrate=> 


MERN =>

mongodb => it is database , store data in formate similar to json

express => 

node => it powers the back end of our application, it lets run js on the server,
        

                                        v8 chrome engine 
        human readable js code      -------------------> machine readable



npm=>  npm is like  a big database, there are variety of libraries and packaegs


how to start backend project =>
npm init  => some questions
npm init -y => directly installed


core modules of node js =>

1. fs => it is a nodejs core module, used to handle ffile system 
            opeartion such as reading, creating, delete

2. Os =>  
3. http => it is node.js core module that help in creating web server,and 
            handle http, requests and responses.

            limitation of http core modules
                         => routing complex
                         => code lengthy
                         => middleware not supperted 







SERVER => A server is a person that communicate with client
        A server is a computer program that responsible for preparing and delivering
         data to the other computer




client/UI => 
waiter------> server
chef------> databases
MENU ------> API 
single item of that menu------->            Endpoint




           req-get/post/put
client  ----------------------> server----------------> databse(mongodb)
`           <----------------res(json)  



Main concept of database =>
c => create/insert/add =>  
r => read /fetch / retrieve
u => update
d => delet




two types of databases =>
        1. sql => data is stored in table form-> table is made of rows and columns
        2. no-sql => data is stored in collection--> a collection is made up Document



        sql                 mongodb 
        table            collections
        Row /Record      Document
        column           field

        download =>     1. mongodb server
                        2. mongodb shell
                        3. MONGODB compass


 how to connect node.js application and mongodb database
 node application => javascript 
                                        => mongodb driver
 mongodb  => own language

 mongodb driver =>  it is essential because it acts like a bridge node
                         and mongodb

                the driver translate js code from node js into formate
                 that mongodb understand 



mongoose => npm i mongoose



middleware=>
        1. Middleware sits between req and response
        2. it is basically a function that have access to req and res 
           object in an express , along with next ()

        use =>
        1. processing request
        2. Routing 
        3. error handling
        4. performing action before response 


Authentication   =>
        in node.js Authenticationn is the process of of verifying the identity of a user
        trying to access a system or resources.

        commonly this involves checking a user's credentials, such as a username password
        to allow or deny access.



Authorization =>  Authorization in node.js  means deciding  what an authenticated user is allowed to do in a 
                 application.


                 user logged (Authentication) 

                 now system check => (RBAC) => role based access control
                        can this user view data 
                        can this user edit/add/update




data => 
1. buyer => buyername, email, number, product1, product2
2. seller => sellername, sellerId, product1, product2 , monthlyincome
3. product => productname, price, reating , image





node js application 


mongodb database => 






mongoose Schema : define how your data should look like, with fields
                like firstname, lastname, contact, role

model  => it is created using the schema and now be used to interact 
        with the  database




sending data from postman (post method)


body-parser is a middleware in express.js
it is used to parse and extract the data in the body of incoming
         http request (like Post)
it takes data from the body of requesst and convert it 
        into formate (like json) that we can use in our code
